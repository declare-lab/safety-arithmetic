## FileStructure

### Safety Arithmetic
```
Run Safety_Arithmetic_Base_and_SFT.ipynb file for BASE and SFT models.
Run Safety_Arithmetic_Edited.ipynb file for EDITED models.
```
### Harm Direction Removal (HDR) (w/ TIES)
```
Run HDR/HDR_TIES_BASE_AND_SFT.ipynb for SFT models and BASE models
Run HDR/HDR_TIES_EDITED.ipynb for EDITED model.
```
### Harm Direction Removal (HDR) (w/ Task Vector)
```
Run HDR/HDR_Task_Vector_BASE.ipynb for BASE models
Run HDR/HDR_Task_Vector_SFT.ipynb for SFT models
Run HDR/HDR_Task_Vector_EDITED.ipynb for EDITED models.
```
### Only ICV
```
Run Safety_Arithmetic_Base_and_SFT.ipynb file by passing direct base/sft (without HDR).
Run Safety_Arithmetic_Edited.ipynb file by passing direct edited (without HDR).
```
